* The Android app will have all the features that the desktop App has

## Technologies & Frameworks User

* **Flask:** A micro web framework written in Python, used for handling backend logic, routing, and server-side operations.

* **Python:** The core programming language used for server-side logic and interaction with the database.

## Creating Android APP

* I'm assuming you've already performed the steps mentioned in Getting Started Section

1. **Install Buildozer:** Install Buildozer
```bash
pip3 install --user --upgrade buildozer
```

2. **Connect Android Device:** Connect your android device to the local machine, you can check if the device is connected or not by the following bash commands
```bash
adb devices
# If the service needs to start
adb start-server
adb --help
```

3. **Update Buildozer Spec:** If needed you can change the spec info in buildozer.spec file

4. **Run Buildozer:** Run Buildozer
```bash
buildozer -v android debug deploy run logcat > app_log.txt
```
* this will take a long time to build on the first run, on successful completion you'll find the apk file in bin/ folder
* this will also create a app_log.txt file for debugging and logging
* the apk will automatically be installed on your Android Device on success
